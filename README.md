# Using Copilot
The creator of Advent of Code doesn't want us using AI to automatically and wholely solve the puzzles -- and I wholeheartedly agree.

However, Copilot is a tool that I use in both my personal projects and at work. It's part of my workflow, and I'm not going to stop using it.
I have a unique way of learning. I learn by throwing myself into the deep end and finding my way out, usually by Googling my hyperspecific issues. Copilot, in this last year, has replaced that need for needing to Google it.

For what it's worth, I have no intention of shoving the puzzle instructions into the editor for Copilot to solve. The same way Copilot didn't write [scyllax] for me -- it just filled in the tedious bits.
